# Software-Engineering
Road Traffic project based on UML and Java



The project is divided into 4 subsystems:
- Subsystem I - Traffic control and detection
- Subsystem II - Traffic participants
- Subsystem III - Control system
- Subsystem IV - Road maintenance   --->  The focus is on this one


On the other branches you can find the same milestones but with all the subsystems. On the main will be just the Road Maintenance part.
