# Software-Engineering
Road Traffic project based on UML and Java



The project is divided into 4 subsystems:
- Subsystem I - Traffic control and detection
- Subsystem II - Traffic participants
- Subsystem III - Control system
- Subsystem IV - Road maintenance   --->  The focus is on this one

Milestone 3 --> Group
The contents of this report are organized using the following structure:
1. The source code of all projects with executable test cases and documented APIs (Task
1).
2. Reflection on code and the design decisions (Task 2).
3. Reflection on requirements and initial design with respect to the finished
implementation (Task 3).


Tasks did for this milestone:
1. Finish implementing the selected features.
a. Implement the proper logic of your selected features.
b. Provide unit tests for the core classes and system tests for the entire system.
c. Document the APIs and hard to understand algorithms.
2. Reflect on code and on the code of colleagues in terms of good and bad
design decisions (~ 300 words).
a. What would you make different to improve the usability of
APIs/interfaces/GUIs?
b. What was the hardest part to implement and why?
c. What technological decision do each one of us regret or are happy of?
d. etc.
3. Reflect on the previously made design and found requirements in terms of current
implementation progress (~ 300 words).
a. How well could you fulfill our found requirements?
b. How well did the design match implementation and where and why are
there differences?
c. Which requirements were hard to grasp?
d. etc.
