# Software-Engineering
Road Traffic project based on UML and Java



The project is divided into 4 subsystems:
- Subsystem I - Traffic control and detection
- Subsystem II - Traffic participants
- Subsystem III - Control system
- Subsystem IV - Road maintenance   --->  The focus is on this one


On the other branches you can find the same milestones but with all the subsystems. On the main will be just the Road Maintenance part. The whole project was done by 5 students, my part was doing the Road maintenance subsystem and integrating it to work with others.



Milestone 1:
The contents of the report are organized using the following structure:
1. Context/boundaries for each subsystem
2. Stakeholders of the subsystems and document their goals
3. Subsystem requirements
4. List of Risks
5. Glossary

Milestone 2:
The contents of the report are organized using the following structure:
1. Deployment diagram and a paragraph explaining the shown artifacts.
2. State machine diagram and a paragraph explaining the shown states.
3. Class diagram and an explanation (~50 words) of the most important concepts.

Milestone 3:
The contents of the report are organized using the following structure:
1. List of features implemented and mention how they are related to teammates projects
and reason behind.
2. Readable images of interface mock-ups.
3. A list of selected technologies with a short explanation why I think it is a good choice.
Further, comparrison of the selection to other existing solutions.
4. The source code of project in which I started implementing the APIs, features and
infrastructure.
